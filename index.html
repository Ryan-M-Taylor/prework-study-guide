        <ul>
          <li>An element is a type of content on a webpage.</li>
          <li>Common types of elements to add content to a page include text, image, header, and list.</li>
          <li>Common element types that are used to divide and describe a page include meta-related, content division, and semantic.</li>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>"ul" creates an unordered list</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>When a developer wants to style an element directly in the HTML file they use inline CSS.</li>
          <li>An internal style sheet contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file.</li>
          <li>An external CSS style sheet allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file.</li>
          <li>When using an external style sheet, we link the file using a "link" element placed in the HTML's head.</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>A selector defines the element or attributes to which the rules, or declarations, will apply.</li>
          <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property.</li>
          <li>The "rel" attribute specifies the relationship between the current document and the linked document resource.</li>
          <li>The "href" attribute specifies the location (URL) of the external resource.</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>JavaScript is read from top to bottom, and the order matters.</li>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>var keyword = : declares the keyword as a variable</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>Right click and inspect page to open the Chrome DevTools.</li>
          <li>console.log : allows developers to debug and test the code that they wrote</li>
          <li>if, else if : are conditional statements to introduce decision-making into the code</li>
          <li>A value is considered falsy if it one of the following values : 0, -0, On, "", null, undefined, NaN, or a Boolean type with the value of false. All other values, including a Boolean with the value of true, are considered truthy.</li>
          <li>"===" : strict equality operator, checks to see if two values are equal. Returns true if equal, false if not equal.</li>
          <li>An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data. The first item in an array has an index of 0.</li>
          <li>A "for" loop used the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over.</li>
          <li>A function is a simple set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a task. A function must be called in order to execute it.</li>
